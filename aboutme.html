			<h1>Bouldering &amp; Rock Climbing</h1>
			<h2>Bouldering has become a really important part of my life. It helped me learn how to have fun with physical activity, which helped me lose a lot of weight in early 2015. Now I frequent climbing gyms in Toronto and Waterloo whenever I get the chance.</h2>

			<h1>Board Games</h1>
			<h2>I am a large collector of board games. When my high school friends and I started watching TableTop, we immediately started doing board game nights any time we could.</h2>
