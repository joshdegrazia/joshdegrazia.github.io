			<h1>Bouldering &amp; Rock Climbing</h1>
			<p>I started bouldering in early 2015. Bouldering has become a really important part of my life. It helped me learn how to have fun with physical activity, which helped me lose a lot of weight and become much more confident about my body image. Now I frequent climbing gyms in Toronto and Waterloo whenever I get the chance.</p>

			<h1>Board Games</h1>
			<p>I am a large collector of board games. When my high school friends and I started watching TableTop, we immediately started doing board game nights any time we could. Now, I frequently visit gaming nights held by the university's mathematics society, as well as events held by groups on Meetup.com when I'm in Toronto.</p>

			<h1>Music</h1>
			<p>Over the years, music has become one of the most important parts of my life. I try my best to listen to and appreciate every genre equally, but I often lean towards classic rock and grunge. Live music has become a staple in my life, as well. Some of my favourite shows have been Foo Fighters, which I saw in 2015 during the Broken Leg Tour, and Rush, who I watched during their 2010 Time Machine tour.</p>
