				<h2>January 2016 - April 2016</h2>
				<p>During this term, I worked on an internal utility built in Python. It was built using the wx user interface library. This utility processed text files which are usually sent to the government, and automatically generated test responses. This way, we could use the generated files, instead of creating them by hand. It was a great introduction to learning Python; it taught me how a good Python program looked like, and got me interested in working with it outside of the workplace.</p>
				<h2>May 2015 - August 2015</h2>
				<p>I worked on the later stages of a translation during this summer. Primarily, I worked out the kinks in C# which appeared along the way with translation. I worked closely with QA resources - a lot of the time acting as a QA resource myself - to make the program cohere to its previous iterations. During this term, a lot of issues were tackled by building backend resources and new UI elements in order to get the program to behave.</p>
				<h2>May 2014 - August 2014</h2>
				<p>During my first term at RPM, they asked me to design a process for translating one of their old programs, written in Visual Basic 6, into the more modern .NET framework. To do this, we started with an old VB6-to-Java converter that the company had used previously to port another application. From there, we transformed the code that it output into C#.</p>
